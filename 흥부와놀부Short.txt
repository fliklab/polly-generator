Two brothers named Nolbu and Hongbu had different personalities. 
Nolbu was greedy and Hongbu was kind. 
Nolbu stole their parents' inheritance and Hongbu had to leave with his family. 
One day, a small injured bird came to Hongbu's yard and he took care of it. 
The bird gave him some seeds that grew into a tree that bore amazing treasures. 
Nolbu asked for the secret and hurt the bird to get the same rewards. 
But he found only trouble and misfortune. 
Hongbu shared his wealth with Nolbu and taught us to be kind and generous.
