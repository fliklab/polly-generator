<p>The lazy man begged to switch hats, but he couldn't remove the cowhide hat once he put it on, and he turned into a cow.</p>

<p>One day, the cow found a field of radishes, and remembering the old man's warning that he would die if he ate them, he ate them anyway and turned back into a human.</p>

<p>The cow went back to the old man's house, but he was gone, so the cow returned home with only the remaining cloth, and he lived happily ever after.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that laziness brings nothing but trouble, and hard work pays off in the end.</p>
