Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a kind woodcutter.
He was poor but had a good and honest personality.
The woodcutter worked hard every day to cut wood.
One day, while cutting down a big tree next to a pond, he accidentally dropped his only axe into the water.
Feeling hopeless after losing his only axe, the woodcutter was crying out loud.
Suddenly, a mountain spirit appeared and asked why he was crying so sadly.
The woodcutter explained his situation to the mountain spirit.
Feeling sorry for the woodcutter, the mountain spirit promised to find his axe and disappeared.
