Once upon a time, a scholar was climbing up a mountain to visit the capital city of Hanyang to see the past.
Along the way, he saw a baby magpie that was about to be eaten by a snake, so he killed the snake to save the magpie.
As he kept walking through the mountain, it became dark, and he couldn't find a place to stay for the night.
Eventually, he found a house and asked if he could stay the night.
A beautiful woman came out and allowed him to stay.
While the scholar was sleeping in the middle of the night, he suddenly felt suffocated.
When he woke up, he found a large snake coiled around his body.
The snake told him that it was the wife of the snake he had killed earlier to save the magpie, and that it had been left alone to harbor a grudge.
The snake was supposed to become a dragon and ascend to the heavens after spending only one night with the scholar, but it could no longer do so because of its hatred towards him.
The scholar asked the snake for mercy, but it refused to let him go.
Instead, it promised to release him if a bell rang three times before dawn.
The scholar was unable to ring the bell himself since he was bound by the snake.
He gave up, thinking that he would die helplessly.
But as dawn approached, he heard the sound of the bell ringing from far away.
When the bell rang three times, the snake, unable to take revenge on its husband's death, disintegrated and became a dragon, ascending to the heavens.
The scholar, who had risked his life to save the magpie, was curious about who had rung the bell.
He went to the place where the bell was and found a dead mother magpie.
She had thrown herself on the bell to save the scholar, in return for saving her baby magpie.
To repay the magpie's kindness, the scholar buried the dead magpies properly.
The magpie threw herself on the bell to save the scholar, in return for his kindness.
Maybe we should all take a moment to think about how we can repay the small kindnesses shown to us by those who help us around us
