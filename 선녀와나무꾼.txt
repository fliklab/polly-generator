Once upon a time, there was a poor woodcutter who couldn't afford to get married.
One day, he saved a deer from a hunter and in return, the deer told him the location of a fairy spring and gave him advice on how to marry a fairy and have children.
The fairy warned the woodcutter not to give her a set of wings until after their children were born.
They married and had two children, but the fairy became homesick and begged the woodcutter to see her wings.
He gave in and she flew away with their children to the fairy world.
The woodcutter went to the deer for advice on how to find his family and was told to wait by the fairy spring until the fairies bathed in it.
He rode a drop of dew to the fairy world and found his family.
They were happy, but the woodcutter missed his mother, so he returned to Earth for a visit.
His mother gave him a pot of red bean porridge to share with his family, but the woodcutter accidentally spilled it on his horse, causing it to run away with him to the sky.
He fell to the ground and was unable to return to the fairy world, living out the rest of his days as a rooster, mourning his lost family by crowing at dawn.
