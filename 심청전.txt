Once upon a time, in a village, there was a kind and beautiful girl named Sim Cheong, who was the daughter of a man called Sim Bongsa, known for his good deeds. 
Sim Cheong worked hard to earn money and helped her father with the household chores. 
One day, Sim Bongsa was walking, and he fell into a stream because he was blind. 
A monk came and promised to restore his sight for 300 bags of rice.
Sim Bongsa promised to pay the monk and was upset because he did not have the money. 
Sim Cheong noticed her father's worries and found out about the promise to the monk. 
She heard that a sea dragon demanded a girl's sacrifice to calm the waves, so Sim Cheong decided to sell herself for the 300 bags of rice.
Before leaving, Sim Cheong cooked a delicious meal for her father, paid the monk, and went on a ship towards the sea. 
She fell overboard and met the sea dragon. 
The dragon was moved by her sincerity and allowed her to ride a lotus flower over the waves.
Sim Cheong eventually married a king and became the queen. 
But she missed her father and invited all the civil servants to a banquet to help her find him. 
She called her father's name, and he recognized her voice and saw her for the first time. 
They lived happily ever after.
Sim Cheong is a classic Korean folktale, and it emphasizes the importance of filial piety. 
She sacrifices herself to help her father and shows the audience the importance of gratitude towards one's parents.
