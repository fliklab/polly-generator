Once upon a time, there was a very lazy man who did nothing but eat, sleep and play all day.
One day, he encountered an old man making a cowhide hat.
The lazy man mocked the old man, but the old man said the hat could grant wishes.
The lazy man begged to switch hats, but he couldn't remove the cowhide hat once he put it on, and he turned into a cow.
The old man sold the cow to a farmer, who worked the cow hard every day.
The cow realized the error of his ways and promised to work harder.
One day, the cow found a field of radishes, and remembering the old man's warning that he would die if he ate them, he ate them anyway and turned back into a human.
The cow went back to the old man's house, but he was gone, so the cow returned home with only the remaining cloth, and he lived happily ever after.
The moral of the story is that laziness brings nothing but trouble, and hard work pays off in the end.
